Description of the Project

This is the first part of the AirBnB clone project where i worked on the backend of the project while interfacing it with a console application with the help of the cmd module in python.

The Data(python object) that are generated are stored in a json file and can be aaccessed with the help of the json module in python.

Description of the command interpreter

The application is interfaced just like the bash shell accepts commands that were solely defined for the purpose of the usage of the AirBnB website.
The command line interpreter serves as the frontend of the web app where users can interact with the backend which was developed with python OOP programming.
some of the commands available are:
Show
Create
Update
Count
Destory

As part of the implementation of the command line interpreter coupled with the backend and FileStorage system, the following action can be performed:
* Creating new objects(examples:a new user or a place)
* Retrieving an object from a file, a database e.t.c)
* Doing operations on objects (count, compute stats, e.t.c)
* Updating attributes of an object
* Destroying an object

How to start it
These helps to get the project up and running on your local machine (Ubuntu) for development and for testing purposes.

Installing
You will clone the repository of the project from Github. It will also contain the simple shell program and all of the dependencies.

https://github.com/Uchemel/AirBnB_clone.git

After cloning the respository you will have a folder called AirBnB_clone. In there will be saved files that will allow the program to work.
